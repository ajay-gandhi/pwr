# pwr

As of now this is in proof-of-concept mode and I'm too lazy to write docs and
install instructions (you need `electron-prebuilt` and then `npm install` the
deps). There's a lot of work to be done, but it's definitely working out :)

## TODO

* Quit apps by full path rather than name, maybe
* Probably want to add the option of multiple thresholds, e.g. close W at X% and
  Y at Z%.
* Finish right side styling, I'm thinking make the selection smaller. Both
  buttons should remain far from each other to prevent accidental clicking.
